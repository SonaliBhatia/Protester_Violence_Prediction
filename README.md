### Recommendations:
What this project has highlighted the most, is that violence brings violence. Because the state violence and protester violence are so heavily correlated (and because we cannot tell who incites violence each time) all options for a non violent response should be taken first.
For government polive forces preparing, they should also pay attention to the type of protest happening:
    - Protests are more likely to happen on the 1st or the 15th of the month.
    - Larger protests tend to be less violent.
    - Protests regarding police brutality tend to be the most volatile.
By preparing in advance, and having an understanding of the situation they are walking into, police forced have more of an opportunity to minimize the violence happening globally.
